Fine, we have now established the basic structure of your project. In the next
step you have to determine which WORKFLOWS you want to run.

Accordingly in the CONFIGFILE you will find the WORKFLOWS dictionary key at the
top of the file. Here you can switch on workflows by entering them here.
A specific order is not needed.
for example, it can look like this:

                    "WORKFLOWS" :       "QC,TRIMMING,MAPPING,DE,DTU",

For the most of the workflows several tools are available. We will choose them
in the next step.

There are some postprocessing workflows:

 > DE         Differential Expression analysis
 > DEU        Differential Exon-Usage analysis
 > DAS        Differential Alternative Splicing analysis
 > DTU        Differential Transcript Usage

In addition to these key-value pairs the CONFIGFILE will contain a seperate
section for each of the specified WORKFLOWS. Please note, that we go through
these detailed settings later. Now you just determine, which section will be
prepared.

these workflows are at the moment available:
